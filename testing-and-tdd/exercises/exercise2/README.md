# Testing and TDD - exercise 2

The file `tennis.py` contains a class `TennisGame` which is used to keep track of the score in a tennis game.
Tennis has a quite peculiar scoring system (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring) 
for a description).

The `TennisGame` has a method `player_1_won()` to be called when player one wins a ball 
and a second method `player_2_won()` to be called when player two wins a ball. 
Both these methods return the current score.

There are two sets of unit test for this class - `testsA.py` and `testsB.py`. 

1. Get acquainted with the code - both the production code (`tennis.py`) and the two test files. 
2. Run the two different test files and make sure all tests pass (run `pytest testsA.py` in the `exercise2` directory) 
3. Looking at the test code, which of the two sets (`testsA.py` and `testsB.py`) is better?
4. The `TennisGame` class seems to work as intended, but has a some issues.
For example, it allows a state where both player have _advantage_ - something that is impossible in real life. 
Refactor the class to keep the number of balls won instead the points. That is, change the class definition 
to something like

```
class TennisGame:

    def __init__(self):
        self.numberOfBallsWon1 = 0
        self.numberOfBallsWon2 = 0
```

and the code accordingly. What happens to the tests if you do this?
