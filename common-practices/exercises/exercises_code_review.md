## Exercise 1: pair programming

In this exercise you will try out pair programming using the driver-navigator technique.

Remember that:

> The Driver is the person coding. She is focussed on completing the tiny goal at hand, ignoring larger issues for the moment. A driver should always talk through what she is doing while doing it.

> The Navigator is in the observer position, while the driver is typing. She reviews the code on-the-go, gives directions and shares thoughts. The navigator also has an eye on the larger issues, bugs, and makes notes of potential next steps or obstacles.

> **Martin Fowler, [On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)**

In this task you will have to:

1. Work in pairs and try to code the [Fibonacci function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) or other function suggested by an instructor.

> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn , form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

2. Switch navigator/driver roles.
3. Work in pairs and try to code the [Tribonacci function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers#Tribonacci_numbers) or other function suggested by an instructor.
   > The tribonacci numbers are like the Fibonacci numbers, but instead of starting with two predetermined terms, the sequence starts with three predetermined terms and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding three terms.

## Exercise 2: when may I use Code Reviews?

Now think about how you typically develop code, and how you might institute code review practices within your own working environment. Write down briefly for your own reference (perhaps using bullet points) some answers to the following questions:

- Which 2 or 3 key circumstances would code review be most useful for you and your colleagues?
- Which type of code review would be most useful for each circumstance (and would work best within your own working environment)?
- Taking one of these circumstances where code review would be most beneficial, how would you organise such a code review?

> - Which aspects of the codebase would be the most useful to cover?
> - How often would you do them?
> - How long would the activity take?
> - Who would ideally be involved?
> - Any particular practices you would use?

## Exercise 3: writing a Code Review

Take the code produced by one of the pair programming pairs in the previous exercise, write a formal code review following the [General stuff about code reviews from the NBIS code development guidelines](https://github.com/NBISweden/development-guidelines#general-stuff-about-code-reviews). Share your review with the authors and discuss. Take into consideration the NBIS guidelines when writing reviews.
